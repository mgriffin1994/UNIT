code:

src/cocogan_train.py
-add the new div_dis_update method

src/trainers/cocogan_trainer.py
-remove _compute_kl methods in gen_update and add loss for divergence discriminator (from AVB paper)
-add div_dis_update method to train the divergence discriminator (from AVB paper)

src/trainers/cocogan_nets.py
-remove GaussianNoiseLayer in COCOResGen (from middle shared layer)
-change forward in COCOResGen to take in 2 noise inputs
-change architecture of COCOResGen slightly to accomodate these 2 noise inputs
-add new COCODivDis class for divergence discriminator architecture (from AVB paper)
